title: Install Spotify on Xbox one in India

Spotify has recently [released their app for Xbox one](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/p/spotify-music-for-xbox/9nfq49h668tb) but users from India can't download since its not yet released in India. A simple trick to install Spotify from India is to change your location to one of the released countries and install.

Go to `Settings >> System >> Location` and change to United States or United Kingdom. Once changed it will ask you to restart your console and after the restart you can see spotify in app store which will be available to install.

Once installed you can follow the same instructions to reset your location but you still will be able to use Spotify without any issues.
