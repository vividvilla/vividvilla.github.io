title: Hello world!

Its been a while I wrote anything on internet, feel like its right time to start writing again. Planning to share my programming experiences, travel stories and rants on random subjects.

Finally moved this blog from WordPress to my own static blog generator called [olaf](https://github.com/vividvilla/olaf) hosted on Github, hope this will also keeps me motivated to support the project too.
